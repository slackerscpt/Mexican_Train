Ideas:
Seperate backend and front end. 

Backend:
    Create functions for each score call
    Be able to call and update data
    Be able to display all scores by round (hand back full data)

Front End:
    For now still focus on command line
    Work on ability to make it html page


Database:
    Player:
        1) Create player name TABLE
        2) Update player name TABLE
        3) Delete player name TABLE
        4) Read player name TABLE
    Game Details:
        1) CRUD details TABLE (max domino)
    Score:
        1) Create player name TABLE
        2) Update player name TABLE
        3) Delete player name TABLE
        4) Read player name TABLE 
        5) Need function to get scores by player
        6) Need function to get all scores
        7) Need function to determine rankings
        
    Scores
