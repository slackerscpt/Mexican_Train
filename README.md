KNOWN ISSUES
##

Ranks does not consider when players are tied

Need to display out the scores like excel chart

Need to make into web program, instead of command line



# New Ideas
# Build backend - 
# In database put
# Players
    # id, name
# Dominos
    # id - Domino value
    # played (boolena)
# Scores
    # id, domino, player_id, score

# as dominos are played we will update boolean to true
# total score will be from database query
# Maybe table for player total score?
# Need to handle ties adn tie breakers
# Send message if tie breaker used


# UI will be dumb
# Input players
# Input Dominos
# Score Rounds
# Show overall standings
# Show winner
